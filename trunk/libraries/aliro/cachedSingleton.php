 * These classes provide cache logic, and for no special reason, the profiling
 * logic that supports the timing of operations, aliroProfiler.
 *
 * cachedSingleton is the base for building a singleton class whose internal
 * data is cached.  It is used extensively within the core, especially for the
 * handlers that look after information about the main building blocks of the
 * CMS, such as menus, components, modules, etc.  It provides common code for
 * them so that it becomes simple to create a cached singleton object.
 *
 * aliroBasicCache is the class containing rudimentary cache operations.  It
 * was initially independently developed, and subsequently modified to contain
 * the features of CacheLite.  Except that a number of decisions have been
 * taken as well as the code being exclusively PHP5 - these factors make the
 * code a lot simpler.
 *
 * aliroSingletonObjectCache does any special operations needed in the handling
 * of cached singletons, extending aliroBasicCache.
 *
 * Further cache related code that emulates the services of CacheLite (more or
 * less) is found elsewhere (in aliroCentral.php at the time of writing).
